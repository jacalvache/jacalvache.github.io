This study developed a Latin American Spanish version of the HSPSC for use in perioperative settings and examines its psychometric properties.  METHODS: After translation and adjustments, a web-based questionnaire was administered to all health care personnel at operating room in a public university-affiliated hospital in Popayán, Colombia. Descriptive statistics, internal reliability, confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis, and intercorrelations among survey composites were calculated.  RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis showed inadequate model fit for the original 12-factor structure of the HSPSC. Rather, a 9-factor, 36-item instrument showed acceptable factor loadings, internal consistency, and psychometric properties. Five factors were formed with minor changes. Adjusted factors emerged, like \"staffing and work pressure\" and \"supervisor/manager expectations and actions promoting patient safety,\" \"organizational learning-continuous improvement,\" and \"hospital management support for safety,\" as well as \"repeated errors and perception of safety.\" Internal consistency for each remaining composite met or exceeded a Cronbach α value of 0.60.  CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric analyses provided overall support for 9 of the 12 initial factors of patient safety culture. Our findings suggest that more validation studies need to be conducted before applying safety dimensions from the original HSPSC to perioperative settings only. By providing this initial tool, we hope to stimulate further studies and the patient safety research agenda in this part of the world.","tags":null,"title":"Psychometric Properties of the Latin American Spanish Version of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture Questionnaire in the Surgical Setting:","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José Andrés Calvache"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f7abf7dcf95a62d5aaa175277c1e0d22","permalink":"/publication/content/publication/calvache-era-2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-09T22:56:40.033555Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/calvache-era-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The era of digital diffusion and changes in biomedical publishing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José Andrés Calvache"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"54aada5baa0b8e0154e30724e507d556","permalink":"/publication/content/publication/calvache-enhancing-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-09T22:56:40.029984Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/calvache-enhancing-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Enhancing the value of research reports: time for complete reporting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.A.

It is the most common non‐degenerative articular disease in developing countries. The most vulnerable population for septic arthritis includes infants and preschoolers, especially boys. Septic arthritis disproportionately affects populations of low socioeconomic status. Systemic corticosteroids and antibiotic therapy may be beneficial for treatment of septic arthritis. Even if the joint infection is eradicated by antibiotic treatment, the inflammatory process may produce residual joint damage and sequelae.  Objectives To determine the benefits and harms of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in children with a diagnosis of septic arthritis.  Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov), and Google Scholar. We searched all databases from their inception to 17 April 2018, with no restrictions on language of publication.  Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with patients from two months to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of septic arthritis who were receiving corticosteroids in addition to antibiotic therapy or as an adjuvant to other therapies such as surgical drainage, intra‐articular puncture, arthroscopic irrigation, or debridement.  Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, data extraction, and evaluation of risk of bias. We considered as major outcomes the presence of pain, activities of daily living, normal physical joint function, days of antibiotic treatment, length of hospital stay, and numbers of total and serious adverse events. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table.  Main results We included two RCTs involving a total of 149 children between three months and 18 years of age who were receiving antibiotics for septic arthritis. The most commonly affected joints were hips and knees. These studies were performed in Costa Rica and Israel. In both studies, dexamethasone administered intravenously (ranging from 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose every six to eight hours) during four days was the corticosteroid, and the comparator was placebo. Trials excluded patients with any degree of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression. The longest follow‐up was one year. Trials did not report activities of daily living nor length of hospital stay. Both studies used adequate processes for randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding, and review authors judged them to have low risk of selection and performance bias. Losses to follow‐up were substantive in both studies, and we judged them to have high risk of attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting. We graded all outcomes as low quality due to concerns about study limitations and imprecision.  The risk ratio (RR) for absence of pain at 12 months of follow‐up was 1.33, favouring corticosteroids (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.72; P = 0.03; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 13, 95% CI 6 to 139; absolute risk difference 24%, 95% CI 5% to 43%).  The RR for normal function of the affected joint at 12 months of follow‐up was 1.32, favouring corticosteroids (95% CI 1.12 to 1.57; P = 0.001; NNTB = 13, 95% CI 7 to 33; absolute risk difference 24%, 95% CI 11% to 37%).  We found a reduction in the number of days of intravenous antibiotic treatment favouring corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) ‐2.77, 95% CI ‐4.16 to ‐1.39) based on two trials with 149 participants.  Researchers did not report length of hospital stay. One trial (49 participants) reported that treatment with dexamethasone was associated with a shorter duration of IV antibiotic treatment, leading to a shorter hospital stay, and although duration of hospitalisation was a primary outcome of the study, study authors did not provide data on the duration of hospitalisation. We downgraded the quality by one level for concerns about study limitations (high risk of attrition bias and selective reporting), and by another level for imprecision.  In one trial of 49 participants, researchers followed 29 children for 12 months, and parents reported that no children demonstrated adverse effects of the intervention.  Authors' conclusions Evidence for corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in children with a diagnosis of septic arthritis is of low quality and is derived from the findings of two trials (N = 149). Corticosteroids may increase the proportion of patients without pain and the proportion of patients with normal function of the affected joint at 12 months, and may also reduce the number of days of antibiotic treatment. However, we cannot draw strong conclusions based upon these trial results. Additional randomised clinical trials in children with relevant outcomes are needed.","tags":null,"title":"Corticosteroids for septic arthritis in children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Catalina Quilindo","Jose Andrés Calvache","Mario Delgado-Noguera"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"8cf94dfc2176843ea0b379160cfaf2cf","permalink":"/publication/content/publication/quilindo-scientific-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-09T22:56:40.025169Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/quilindo-scientific-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction: Bibliometric indexes are important indicators of the quality of the country’s medical programs. There are few studies of this kind at the Universidad del Cauca.  Objective: To evaluate the scientific-academic activity of the Faculty of Health Sciences (FHS) of the Universidad del Cauca based on bibliometric production indicators of the authors, visibility and impact during the period 2010-2016.  Materials and methods: Descriptive, cross-sectional, bibliometric research. Different categories of the academic production of the FHS were identified (citation by authors, language of publication, areas of health sciences), and the main journals where the authors published. In addition, the metric indicators of the journals and citation indexes of the authors were determined, as well as their enrollment in research groups and the most cited publications according to SCOPUS.  Results: 183 articles were found. The main language of publication was Spanish and mainly in the clinical-surgical area. 60% of the articles of the main authors have some international collaboration. The Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud of Universidad del Cauca had the largest number of articles published by authors of the same faculty during the period under study.  Conclusion: The scientific and academic production and visibility of the FHS of the Universidad del Cauca is low. The findings reveal the need for greater institutional support for research, and the creation and support of research groups and incubators. Therefore, this work seeks to encourage greater visibility of the FHS in the national and international scientific field.","tags":null,"title":"Scientific and academic production and visibility of the Faculty of Health Sciences of Universidad del Cauca","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José Andrés Calvache","Camilo Daza-Perdomo","Julio Gómez-Tamayo","Edison Benavides-Hernández","Andrés Zorrilla-Vaca","Markus Klimek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"b74b716ff8bb3fbd059aa0bb7da9807a","permalink":"/publication/content/publication/calvache-ultrasound-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-09T22:56:40.020977Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/calvache-ultrasound-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Quality problem or issue Ultrasound (US) is a widely propagated medical technology. Anaesthesiologists increase procedural safety by using US techniques, but training and availability are essential for its usage. Although its utility for central venous catheterisation (CVC) is well established, only a paucity of evidence is available regarding its use in low- and middle-income countries. This study is a nationwide survey of Colombian anaesthesiologists designed to explore the current use of US guidance for CVC.  Initial assessment and implementation Web-based survey at National level. Anaesthesiologists registered in the Colombian Society of Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation database.  Choice of solution Demographic variables (age and gender), anaesthesia expertise, years of anaesthesiology practice, US availability, use of US during CVC, reasons for not using US and training experience were collected.  Evaluation Of 351 respondents (12.3% response rate), 45% reported using US sometimes and always for CVC (95% CI 39%–50%) (n = 157). Most anaesthesiologists obtained training in US through external courses (50.4%) or from colleagues (22.8%). Of the total respondents, 62.7% (n = 220) have US equipment available at all time and this factor was independently associated with the use of US for CVC (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 38.6, P textless 0.001).  Lessons learned US guidance is not a common technique used for CVC by Colombian anaesthesiologists; an important barrier for its use is lack of equipment.","tags":null,"title":"Ultrasound guidance for central venous catheterisation.

During airway management, it could have an important role, because it allows real-time measurement of anatomical aspects and a functional evaluation with high safety profile. However, assessment of the reliability and precision of these measurements is critical if sonography is used as a clinical diagnostic tool. The aim of the study was to estimate inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the airway diameter measured by sonography in heathy volunteers.  Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study during 2015 on healthy adult volunteers. Using sonography, transverse internal diameter of subglottic space was measured twice by two blinded sonographers.  Results Agreement was classified as very good for intra-rater measurements (ICC = 0.84) and good for the inter-rater measurements (ICC = 0.71). The 95% CI of agreement limits for the intra-rater measurements were inferior to those for the inter-rater measurements.  Conclusions Ultrasound measurement is a reliable and precise method to measure the internal subglottic diameter of the airway. Ultimately, this method may provide clinicians valuable information regarding airway diameter in adults and may help to guide treatment options.","tags":null,"title":"Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the airway diameter measured by sonography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrés Kamilo Delgado Romero","Yined Marcela Salazar Palechor","Rosalba Díaz","Victoria Eugenia Solano","Germán Ruiz Beltrán","María Andrea García Chaves","José Andrés Calvache"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506816000,"objectID":"16d4c232706f8cf6eddaab39915e4c7b","permalink":"/publication/content/publication/delgado-romero-prognosis-2017/","publishdate":"2020-02-09T22:56:40.039552Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/delgado-romero-prognosis-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction: Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI: community acquired and/or bronchiolitis) is one of the main public health issues for children under five years of age. The main purpose of this research was to describe the epidemiological profile, associated factors, and prognosis of ALRI in two hospitals in Popayán, Colombia. Materials and Methods: This was a cohort study. We included children from 2 months to 5 years of age with diagnoses of severe ALRI. Socio-demographic profiles, clinical features, and prognostic factors were collected. The main outcomes under study were mortality, admission to icu, and length of stay. Multivariable analyses were performed to establish the independent contributions of prognostic factors. Results: 121 patients were included. Incidence of ALRI was 4% CI95% [3,3-4,7] during 6 months of follow-up. Mortality during follow-up was 0,8% (CI95% 0,1-4,4) (one patient). Thirty three percent of children required admission to ICU. Median length of stay was 5 days and length of stay in ICU was 4 days. Preterm birth was independently associated with icu admission (OR=5,1 CI95% [1,3-20] p=0,019). Discussion: The incidence of severe ALRI was 4%. Mortality was low and length of stay was short. Factors related to the diagnosis of ALRI in this cohort are consistent with those reported in the national and international literature, and the only independent prognostic factor for admission to ICU was preterm birth.","tags":null,"title":"Prognosis of Severe Acute Lower Respiratory Infection in Colombian Children under Five Years of Age","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mary Bravo-Peña","Luis Barona-Fong","Julio Campo-López","Yeni Arroyave","José Andrés Calvache"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"42df0000e37ed945fe91b2f8a19df8aa","permalink":"/publication/content/publication/bravo-pena-assessing-2017/","publishdate":"2020-02-09T22:56:40.041083Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/bravo-pena-assessing-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the completeness of reporting of observational studies in Colombian Journal of Anesthesiology.

El acto anestésico quirúrgico como generador de ansiedad se relaciona con mayor vulnerabilidad y difícil control del dolor postoperatorio, estancia hospitalaria prolongada, mayor tasa de accidentes anestésicos y vulnerabilidad a infecciones. Este estudio estimó la prevalencia de ansiedad preoperatoria en un grupo de pacientes sometidos a anestesia general mediante la escala de Ansiedad Preoperatoria y de Información de Ámsterdam (APAIS). Métodos: Estudio observacional de corte transversal con pacientes que recibieron anestesia general en un hospital de III nivel de atención. Se obtuvo información sociodemográfica y clínica. Se determinó la prevalencia de ansiedad preoperatoria mediante la escala APAIS (utilizando un punto de corte de 11) y los potenciales factores asociados. Se realizó un análisis descriptivo y se calcularon odds ratios para las asociaciones. Además, se construyó un modelo de regresión logística para ajustar el efecto de las covariables en la presentación de ansiedad. Resultados: La prevalencia de ansiedad fue de 13% [IC95% 7%-18%]. Las mujeres, los pacientes ambulatorios, clasificación ASA I y sometidos a cirugía mayor sin antecedentes de procedimientos quirúrgicos previos presentaron una mayor frecuencia de ansiedad. La mayoría de los pacientes presentaban una baja necesidad de información (76,8%). Tras el análisis ajustado, no se encontraron variables asociadas de forma importante a la presentación de ansiedad.
