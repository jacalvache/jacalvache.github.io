abstract: "OBJECTIVE: The Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSPSC) was designed to assess staff views on patient safety and has been translated and validated into several languages and settings. This study developed a Latin American Spanish version of the HSPSC for use in perioperative settings and examines its psychometric properties.  METHODS: After translation and adjustments, a web-based questionnaire was administered to all health care personnel at operating room in a public university-affiliated hospital in Popayán, Colombia. Descriptive statistics, internal reliability, confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis, and intercorrelations among survey composites were calculated.  RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis showed inadequate model fit for the original 12-factor structure of the HSPSC. Rather, a 9-factor, 36-item instrument showed acceptable factor loadings, internal consistency, and psychometric properties. Five factors were formed with minor changes. Adjusted factors emerged, like \"staffing and work pressure\" and \"supervisor/manager expectations and actions promoting patient safety,\" \"organizational learning-continuous improvement,\" and \"hospital management support for safety,\" as well as \"repeated errors and perception of safety.\" Internal consistency for each remaining composite met or exceeded a Cronbach α value of 0.60.  CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric analyses provided overall support for 9 of the 12 initial factors of patient safety culture. Our findings suggest that more validation studies need to be conducted before applying safety dimensions from the original HSPSC to perioperative settings only. By providing this initial tool, we hope to stimulate further studies and the patient safety research agenda in this part of the world."
