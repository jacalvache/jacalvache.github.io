abstract: "As one of the pillars of the scientific method, reproducibility refers to the ability of an experiment or evidence to be reproduced or replicated by others, in particular, by the scientific community. Literature in health sciences has been under intense scrutiny in recent years and, as a result, its ability to provide valid and unbiased results is being widely questioned."
