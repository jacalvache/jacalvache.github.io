 abstract = {Quality problem or issue
Ultrasound (US) is a widely propagated medical technology. Anaesthesiologists increase procedural safety by using US techniques, but training and availability are essential for its usage. Although its utility for central venous catheterisation (CVC) is well established, only a paucity of evidence is available regarding its use in low- and middle-income countries. This study is a nationwide survey of Colombian anaesthesiologists designed to explore the current use of US guidance for CVC.

Initial assessment and implementation
Web-based survey at National level. Anaesthesiologists registered in the Colombian Society of Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation database.

Choice of solution
Demographic variables (age and gender), anaesthesia expertise, years of anaesthesiology practice, US availability, use of US during CVC, reasons for not using US and training experience were collected.

Evaluation
Of 351 respondents (12.3% response rate), 45% reported using US sometimes and always for CVC (95% CI 39%–50%) (n = 157). Most anaesthesiologists obtained training in US through external courses (50.4%) or from colleagues (22.8%). Of the total respondents, 62.7% (n = 220) have US equipment available at all time and this factor was independently associated with the use of US for CVC (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 38.6, P \textless 0.001).

Lessons learned
US guidance is not a common technique used for CVC by Colombian anaesthesiologists; an important barrier for its use is lack of equipment.},
